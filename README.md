⏳ Task 1 -> To-Do List Application in Python ⏳
I’m excited to share the first task I worked on to refresh my coding skills. I developed a To-Do List Application using Python. This project helped me brush up on my Python knowledge and focus on creating an efficient and user-friendly task management tool.

Some features I implemented include:

📋 Add, update, and delete tasks dynamically.

✅ Mark tasks as complete or pending.

📊 Display a neat and organized task list to enhance productivity.


Here’s a sneak peek of the application in action:

Looking forward to tackling more challenges! 🚀
